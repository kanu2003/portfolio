# Hi, I'm Kanishka 👋

### Full-Stack Developer | Applied Computer Vision Engineer | Automation Expert

I am a highly versatile engineer focused on building **intelligent, end-to-end systems**—from scalable web backends to real-time AI models and cross-platform automation. My work is defined by the ability to **bridge the gap** between cutting-edge Machine Learning (specifically Computer Vision) and robust, production-ready web applications.

## 💡 Expertise in Focus

My portfolio highlights three core pillars of development:

### 1. 👁️ Applied AI & Computer Vision
I specialize in intelligent systems that interact with the real world, including **OCR, real-time object detection, and image processing**. I focus on deploying these models into live applications.

### 2. ⚙️ Full-Stack & System Architecture
Proficient in both modern frontend (for dynamic UIs) and powerful backend frameworks (**Node.js/Express, Python/Flask**), with expertise in REST APIs, database design (MySQL), and setting up scalable web services.

### 3. 🤖 Automation & IoT
I build automated workflows and monitoring solutions by combining hardware/IoT (for real-world data) with software tools (**Selenium, PyAutoGUI**) for multi-channel alerting and system control.
